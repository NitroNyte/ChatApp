# ChatAppSpring

Chat app Spring
A chat website where users can communicate in real time with each other. Users can register, login, add friends, remove friends, chat with friends in real time.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Technologies used</h2>
The technologies used in this project are:
<br>
For front-end: HTML, CSS(bootstrap), JavaScript(with JQuery).
<br>
For back-end: Java(Spring Boot), MYSql as database.
<br>
Additional: WebSockets(STOMP.js, Sock.js), Signal Protocol(the one as in Signal messenger).


<h2>Overall logic</h2>
What makes this project so special or maybe a little more unique is that it utilises WebSockets to connect to server in real time. Users can receive the messages with delay that is nearly non-existent. Also just for fun it utilises the Signal Protocol, if you would like to implement the Signal Protocol in your project, take a look at my code and hope it will help with it.
<br>

<h2>What is Signal Protocol and why choose it?</h2>
Signal protocol is an encryption/decryption algorithm which is used to encrypt/decrypt information. I have used it in my project just to test it out, but please be ware as my project was Server side rendering this implementation is really not that safe since it requires a seperate Front-End. For more info about the Signal Protocol check out the repo: <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal">libsignal github</a>.
<br>
<h2>End</h2>
This project was done for fun as is not meant to be used in a real life scenario, this is a experiment/prototype that I have done which will be used to make an implementation in the place I'm working. If my project can inspire/help You in any way, You are free to use it or be inspired by it.
