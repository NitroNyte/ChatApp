# ChatAppSpring

Over all logic:
A chat website where users can register, add friends, chat with them(in real time), edit their account and other things.

Technologies used:
Front end - HTML, CSS, JS(JQuery), Thymeleaf(Serverside rendering).

Back end - Java(Spring framework - Spring boot), MySQL.

Already done:
✔  Users can register with a validation format using JQuery.
✔  Users can send, add, delete and chat with friends in a private channel using websockets.
✔  Users can edit their info and be saved in real time.
✔  Private messaging is real time and private, it deferentiates the current user and friend.
✔  User can log out.
✔  Implement a text saying if the user exist and already is a friend of yours in the add panel from the contact page.
✔  Messages are saved in the database then are sent to the user(the correct way).
✔  User can have profile pictures/set them.
✔  



Almost done:
~ Check when the friend you are chatting saw your messages if he checks the chat room.
~ Encryption of the messages, every message sent(by sender) is encrypted and is decrypted on the end user(receiver).



To be done:
►►  Friend list updating dynamically everytime you char(or someone starts a chat) such that the chat room goes on top in the message panel.
►►  Password encryption, can be done with AES or RSA.

►► !!!INDEXING ON THE ON THE SPECIFIC TABLES FOR QUERIES

Idea:
Change the general function of messages already in database, maybe use fetch for it, save in a list then print them out.
Any general ideas by the viewers, especially CEO and CTO.
